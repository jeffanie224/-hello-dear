    " MY name is Jeffanie Monteiro , and making candles is my hobby. I struggled for years to find a hobby that I could enjoy doing and that was therapeutic. There are many different scents, that are used to make candles, the scents can be natural or blended, to create a unique fragrance, an example would be white sage and lavender. Meanwhile Iâ€™ve been able to craft candles that can be used for aroma therapy, such as lavender, eucalyptus, and peppermint. Making candles has also made a way that I can earn some extra income and save money at the same time. Instead of purchasing candles I am now able to make them for myself, family and friends. It makes me think about other products we purchase that we could simply make at home."
